# Spice-Horde
A game made for Replit's 2022 Kajam using Kaboom.js. Based on the theme "spice".

The original idea was a website in which you could create a pizza, and it would mint an NFT of it for free. Sadly, due to time constraints and lack of knowledge, I was not able to implement the minting of NFTs, as after *hours and hours* of researching how to do so, i could not find a solution that i could wrap my head around and implement.

## What I learnt
I developed my understanding and knowledge of JavaScript greatly during this project, although I still have much more to learn.
I learnt how to use local storage on websites and drag and drop events with HTML. 
I also learnt how to use Solidity, deepened my understanding of Smart Contracts, and the blockchain itself.

## Next Steps
I do hope to add the minting of NFTs in the future, although I have much to learn before then. I like the idea of web3 sites and implementation, but I need to learn other things before I can implement the NFT minting.

## Bugs

There are a couple bugs with the drag and dropping on the pizzaMaker.html page, as the ondrop function was not working so i had to combine ondragover and ondragend. Also on MacOS, the drag and dropping works differently, creating a weird user experience I did not know how to fix.
